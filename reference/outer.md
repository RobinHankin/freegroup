# Outer automorphisms of the free group

Vectorized functionality to implement outer automorphisms of the free
group

## Usage

``` r
permsymb_single_X(X,f)
permsymb_single_f(X,f)
permsymb_vec(X,f)
permsymb(X,f)
autosub_lowlevel(M,e,S)
autosub(X,e,S,automorphism_warning=TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- X,S:

  Object of class `free`

- f:

  Permutation function

- M:

  Single free group element, in two-row matrix form

- e:

  Single element to substitute

- automorphism_warning:

  Boolean, with default `TRUE` meaning to give a warning if the
  requested substitution is not an automorphism and `FALSE` meaning not
  to give the warning

## Details

In 1924, Nielsen showed that the automorphism group of the free group
with basis \\\[x_1,\ldots,x_n\]\\ is generated by the following four
elementary Nielsen transformations:

1.  switch \\x_1\\ and \\x_2\\

2.  Cyclically permute \\x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\\ to \\x_2,\ldots,x_n,x_1\\

3.  Replace \\x_1\\ with \\x_1^{-1}\\

4.  Replace \\x_1\\ with \\x_1x_2\\.

The functions documented here give vectorized methods to effect such
outer automorphisms, using the
[permutations](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=permutations) package.

Operations 1 and 2 above generate the symmetric group \\S_n\\ and such
automorphisms are effected by function `permsymb()`. Operation 3 is
carried out by by
[`flip()`](https://robinhankin.github.io/freegroup/reference/subs.md)
and operation 4 by `subsymb()`.

Functions `permsymb_single_X()`, `permsymb_single_f()`, `permsymb_vec()`
and `subsymb_lowlevel()` are low-level helper functions that are not
really suited for the end user; use `permsymb()`, `(flip)` and
`subsymb()` instead.

## Note

Function `permsymb()` is intended to work nicely with the
[permutations](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=permutations) package;
see `inst/outer.Rmd` for some illustrations. The function is not
perfect.

## Examples

``` r
P <- as.free(c("abc","aba","cc","ca"))
autosub(P,"c",as.free("xyz"))
#> [1] a.b.c.x.y.z     a.b.a           c.x.y.z.c.x.y.z c.x.y.z.a      

flip(P,"c")
#> [1] a.b.c^-1 a.b.a    c^-2     c^-1.a  
flip(P,"ac")
#> [1] a^-1.b.c^-1 a^-1.b.a^-1 c^-2        c^-1.a^-1
