# Contributing to `freealg`

Thank you for considering contributing to `freealg`!  I appreciate
your interest in making this project better.  Please read and adhere
to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to maintain a safe,
welcoming, and inclusive environment.  Various forms of contributions
are welcome:

- **Bug reports**: feel free to report any bugs you encounter.
- **Documentation**: typos, clarity issues, or missing guides: your
  help is welcome here.
- **Feature discussions/requests**: got an idea? Open an issue to
  discuss its potential.
- **Code contributions**: all code contributions are welcome.
- **Use cases**: if you use `freealg`, tell me about it!  I want to
  know how the software is being used!

Tests and checks are run on the CI, however locally one can use:
`devtools::test()`.  Ideally each change should be documented.  Major
changes should be `vignettes`.
