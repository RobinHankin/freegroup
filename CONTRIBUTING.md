# Contributing to freealg

Thank you for considering contributing to `freealg`! I appreciate your
interest in making this project better. Please read and adhere to the
[Code of
Conduct](https://robinhankin.github.io/freegroup/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to
maintain a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. Various forms of
contributions are welcome:

- **Bug reports**: feel free to report any bugs you encounter.
- **Documentation**: typos, clarity issues, or missing guides: your help
  is welcome here.
- **Feature discussions/requests**: got an idea? Open an issue to
  discuss its potential.
- **Code contributions**: all code contributions are welcome.
- **Use cases**: if you use `freealg`, tell me about it! I want to know
  how the software is being used!

Tests and checks are run on the CI, however locally one can use:
`devtools::test()`. Ideally each change should be documented. Major
changes should be `vignettes`.
