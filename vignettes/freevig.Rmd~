# The freegroup package

This package provides some functionality for manipulating the free
group on a finite list of symbols.

There is an excellent [wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_group).

Basically, the free group~$\left(X,\circ\right)$ on a
set~$S=\{a,b,c,...,z\}$ is the set~$X$ of *words* that are things like
$c^{-4}bb^2aa^{-1}ca$.  Usually one works only with words that are in
*reduced form*, which has successive powers of the same symbol
combined, in this case it would be $c^{-4}b^3ca$; see how the $a$ term
in the middle has vanished.

The group operation is juxtaposition; thus, for example
$a^2b^{-3}c^2\circ c^-2ba =a^2b^{-3}c^2c^-2ba =a^2b^{-2}ba$.

A word is represented by a two-row integer matrix: The top row is the
integer representation of the symbol and the second row is the
corresponding power.  For example, say we want to
represent~$a^2b^{-3}ac^2$ we would identify $a$ as 1, $b$ as 2, etc
and write


```{r}
(M <- rbind(c(1,2,1,3),c(2,-3,2,3)))
```

Then to convert to a more useful form we would have

```{r}
library(freegroup)
free(M)
```

The package provides other mechanisms to generate words.  To generate 


To combine with another word, say $c^{-2}ad$, we would say:
